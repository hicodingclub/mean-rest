Angular UI componenets and service base classes, used with code generated by mean-rest-angular-cli. It works with the mean-rest-express package to generate the end to end web application. mean-rest-express exposes the Restful API, and the base code from mean-rest-angular consumes the API and makes ready-to-use Angular UI.
